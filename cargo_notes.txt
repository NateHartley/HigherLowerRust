Create a project using `cargo new`
Build a project using `cargo build`
Build and run a project in one step using `cargo run`
Build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using `cargo check`

Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the target/debug directory.
